domino RL

Welcome to the Domino Reinforcement Project!

This project is aimed at finding the optimal strategy for playing dominoes through the use of reinforcement learning techniques. The ultimate goal of this project is to create an AI agent that can play dominoes at an expert level.

Currently, this project is still under development, and the code and documentation are subject to change. The focus of the project is on implementing various reinforcement learning algorithms, such as Q-learning and SARSA, and evaluating their performance in the context of the domino game.

The codebase for this project is written in Python and utilizes the popular reinforcement learning library, TensorFlow, along with other standard data science libraries such as NumPy and Pandas.

To get started with this project, please refer to the documentation included in the repository. This includes instructions on how to set up the project environment, how to run the code, and how to interpret the results.

We welcome any contributions to this project, including bug reports, feature requests, and code contributions. Please refer to the CONTRIBUTING.md file for more information on how to contribute.

Thank you for your interest in the Domino Reinforcement Project. We hope that this project will serve as a useful resource for anyone interested in reinforcement learning and its applications to game playing.
